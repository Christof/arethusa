/** 
 * @ngdoc object
 * @name arethusa.core.LOCALES
 *
 * @description
 * This constant is used to grant access to different localizations
 * of the Arethusa interface.
 *
 * We plan to at least support the following in the future:
 *
 *    de
 *    en
 *    es
 *    fa
 *    fr
 *    hr
 *    it
 *    pt
 *
 * Steps to add a new locale are as follows:
 * 1. add the file named per the iso locale code to dist/i18n
 * 2. add the iso locale code to this constant
 * 3. add a flags css style to _images.scss to represent the flag
 *    on the navbar
 *
 * For the flags css, we use base64 encoded urls, which can be created
 * by using an online converter e.g. like 
 * http://www.greywyvern.com/code/php/binary2base64
 * 
 * Flag source for most countries is from 
 * http://l10n.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/L10N/Flags (but this is missing some)
