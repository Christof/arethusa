## Install

Make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is installed.

```
sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
sudo npm install bower -g

npm install
bower install
```

## Usage

To display a rough demo, start a webserver with

```
grunt server
```

and navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8084/app/index.html]().

During development a watch task (`grunt watch:server`) can optionally be
started - it will live-reload the browser on every change of a js or
html file.
